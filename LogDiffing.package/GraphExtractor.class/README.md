Object representing the graph of one log file ! need a .dot file generated by synoptic !

Constructor: GraphExtractor with: aDotFile

Instance variables: 
- sourceFile: the filename from which the graph was created
- graph: an array with all nodes of the graph 
- links: an array with all links of the graph
- initialNode: a reference towards the initial node 
- terminalode: a reference towards the terminal node 
- labels: a list of all labels in the graphs (used by: )

Methods: 
- `createGraph`: main method for creating and instanciating all variables. Uses: 
	- `fileContent`: gets the String content of sourceFile 
	- `addLabel: aString to: aDict`: Cleans the string, extracts the label and adds it at the correct position in aDict, then returns the index used for the label 
	- `nodeExists: aString`: returns true if a node with the index indicated in the string in argument exists in the graph 
	- `addLink: aString`: add a new link to an existing node in the graph. Uses: 
		- `findNode: aString`: returns node corresponding to the first index in the string (uses getNumberFirst: aString, utilitary method to extract the first number from a String) 
	- `getNumberFirst: aString` 
	- `extractStrBetween: aChar from: aString`: extract the String between the characters aChar from the string 
	- `addNode: aString`: adds the Node object created from the String to the graph nodes 
	- `findNode`
- `computeUnique`: computes all nodes that are unique (label appearing only once), utilitary method for the differ 
- `stripstrig: aString (of: aChar)`: utiliay method to clean up strings
(From no on, all methods are used to get the path within the graph, with or without heuristic)
- `getAllPaths`: computes all paths in the graph (no cycles), utilitary method for the differ. (Lauches getAllPathsWithCycles: 0)
- `getAllPathsWithCycles: aNumber`: computes all paths with a maximum cycle of `aNumber` Uses:
	- `getAllCyclePaths: aNumber`. Simply launches "allCyclePathsHelper" (could be refactored). Uses:
		- `allCyclePathsHelper: maxCycles from: nodeFrom to: nodeTo paths: allPaths currentPath: currentPath`: simple cycle-path creating algo, without heuristic. Uses:
			- `isValid: currentPath withNext: nextNode withCycles: maxCycles`: returns true if `currentPath` doesn't exceed `maxCycle` when node `nextNode` is added
- `getAllPathsWithCycles: cycles andHeuristic: heuristic with: minEdits`: computes all paths with max `cycles` and according to heuristic. Uses:
	- `getAllCyclePaths: maxCycles withHeuristic: startingSize andMinEdit: editSize` launches paths without cycles then heuristic (could be refactored ?) Uses:
		- `allCyclePathsHeuristicHelper: maxCycles pruneSize: startingSize andMinEdit: editSize basePaths: basePaths from: nodeFrom to: nodeTo paths: allPaths currentPath: currentPath diffEnough: diffEnough`
