Object representing the graph of one log file ! need a .dot file generated by synoptic !

Constructor: GraphExtractor with: aDotFile

Instance variables:
	- file: the filename
	- graph: an array with all nodes of the graph 
	- initialNode: a reference towards the initial node
	- terminalode: a reference towards the terminal node
	- labels: a list of all labels in the graphs (used by: )
	
Methods:
	- `createGraph`: main method for creating and instanciating all variables. Uses:
		- `fileContent`: gets the String content of `sourceFile`
		- `addLabel: aString to: aDict`: Cleans the string, extracts the label and adds it at the correct position in aDict, then returns the index used for the label
		- `nodeExists: aString`: returns true if a node with the index indicated in the string in argument exists in the graph
		- `addLink: aString`: add a new link to an existing node in the graph. Uses:
			- `findNode: aString`: returns node corresponding to the first index in the string (uses `getNumberFirst: aString`, utilitary method to extract the first number from a String)
			- `getNumberFirst: aString`
			- `extractStrBetween: aChar from: aString`: extract the String between the characters aChar from the string
		- `addNode: aString`: adds the Node object created from the String to the graph nodes
		- `findNode`
	- `computeUnique`: computes all nodes that are unique (label appearing only once), utilitary method for the differ
	- `getAllPaths`: computes all paths in the graph (no cycles), utilitary method for the differ. Uses:
		- `getOnePath: currentPath with: allPathArray`
		- `noLoop: aPath next: aNode` returns true if there is no loop in the path, false if thre is.
	- `stripstrig: aString (of: aChar)`: utiliay method to clean up strings
